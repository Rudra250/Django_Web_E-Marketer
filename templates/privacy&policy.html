        <h4><b>Collection and Storage of Email Addresses</b></h4>
        <p>When you use our Email Marketing Tool, we may collect and store email addresses in our secure database. 
            The email addresses are collected for the purpose of sending marketing emails as per your instructions. 
            We do not use the email addresses for any other purpose or share them with third parties, except as 
            described in this policy.</p>
        
        <h4><b>Email Verification and OTP</b></h4>
        <p>To ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of email addresses, we require users to verify their email addresses 
            by following an email verification process. Upon registration, we will send an email containing an OTP 
            (One-Time Password) to the provided email address. Users are required to enter this OTP into our application 
            to verify their email address.</p>

        <h4><b>Usage of App Passwords</b></h4>    
        <p>To send emails on behalf of our users, we require them to provide an app password instead of their original and 
            official password of their Gmail account (or any other email service). App passwords are unique passwords generated 
            by the email service provider specifically for use with third-party applications. By using an app password, users 
            can securely authorize our Email Marketing Tool to send emails from their account without disclosing their actual 
            email account password.</p>

        <p>Please note that the app password you provide is securely stored and encrypted in our database. We do not have access
            to your original email account password.</p>


        <h4><b>Data Security</b></h4>
        <p>We take the security of your data seriously and have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures 
            to protect it. We utilize industry-standard security protocols to secure the transmission and storage of email 
            addresses and other related information.</p>

        <h4><b>Retention of Data</b></h4>
        <p>We retain the email addresses stored in our database for as long as you actively use our Email Marketing Tool. If 
            you decide to delete your account or request the removal of your email address from our database, we will promptly 
            delete the data as per your request.</p>

        <h4><b>Changes to the Privacy Policy</b></h4>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify or update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes we make will be posted 
            on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are 
            protecting your information.</p>

        <h4><b>Contact Us</b></h4>
        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy or the practices regarding your personal information, 
            please contact us at rudratemp09@gmail.com</p>
